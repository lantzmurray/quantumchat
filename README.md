Technical Details
Architecture

Quantum Learning Assistant is built on a modular architecture that cleanly separates the AI's core functionalities from the user interface. This approach ensures that updates to the AI or the UI can be made independently, facilitating easy maintenance and scalability.
Core Technologies

    Cohere API: The app utilizes the Cohere API to generate intelligent and contextually relevant responses, demonstrating proficiency in working with external AI services.
    Natural Language Processing: The application employs advanced NLP techniques to process user inputs and generate accurate, informative responses.
    Streamlit: The user interface is developed with Streamlit, providing a seamless and interactive experience for users as they learn about quantum computing.
    WebSocket: Real-time communication is enabled through WebSocket technology, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

Skills Demonstrated

    NLP & AI Integration: Effectively using the Cohere API to provide AI-driven responses tailored for educational purposes in the domain of quantum computing.
    API Integration: Demonstrating the ability to integrate external APIs (Cohere) into a web application to enhance its functionality.
    Software Architecture: Designing a modular, maintainable, and scalable application that can be easily extended or modified.
    Educational Technology: Creating an application that serves as a learning tool, demonstrating an understanding of how to apply AI in educational contexts.
